        Cutting Edge Events - July 22nd, 2021

      <Typography variant='h6' component='h6' gutterBottom>
        Dear <strong>Pavla</strong>. We have prepared this offer with your group
        in mind. We have designed a program that will help your group have a
        terrific time in Barcelona - discover all its hidden corners, eat
        delicious mediterranean food with views of the Mediterranean, or prime
        locations in the city, and all in all, enjoy their visit to the full.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant='h6' component='h6' gutterBottom>
        Here's a map of all the locations that we have proposed for the group.
        If you choose <strong>Hotel HCC Montblanc</strong>, they have offered a
        supplement for half board of â‚¬24p.p for dinner - so you can skip some
        dinners with this half board if you really need to adjust to a tight
        budget.
