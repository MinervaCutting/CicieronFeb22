          <strong>Nuria</strong> opened its doors back in 1926, and it was
          inspired by some of the most romantic Parisian restaurants back then.
          People often think that <em>Nuria</em> must be the name of the owner,
          but it is not. Nuria references the catalan{" "}
          <strong>Nuria Valley</strong> in the Pyrenees, and the owners loved
          the valley, and they thought that Nuria was a good name for a
          restaurant

          During the 50's the place became a meeting point for artists that
          performed in Les Rambles theaters, and had their coffee, or chocolate
          with <em>xurros</em> at Nuria. Some very famous writers and artists
          were regular clients.

          Today, the restaurant has undergone massive restoration, and it is a
          lively and cozy spot in the top part of Les Rambles. They specialize
          in traditional catalan cuisine, and in tapas - with great andalusian
          fried squid, or the delicious ham croquettes as some of their
          specialties.
