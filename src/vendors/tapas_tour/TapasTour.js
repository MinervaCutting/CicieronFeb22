    and we simply have the best ones in town, equally entertaining, funny
    and informative.`,

    comment some of the monuments and hidden corners, as well as some
    gastro-bars to taste traditional tapas alongside with drinks.`,

    tapas in different parts of town, and it takes around 3.5 hours to
    complete.`,
