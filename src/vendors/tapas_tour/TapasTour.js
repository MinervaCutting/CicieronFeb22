        Our <strong>Tapas Tour</strong> combines a gastronomic experience, with
        a guided walking tour of the city's Old Town. This tour can also run in
        the more <strong>Art-nouveau area</strong> of Passeig de Gr√†cia, if
        preferred by the clients.

        <strong>CUTT/events</strong> work with a selection of the best guides in
        Barcelona. By law, every tour needs to include a licensed local guide -
        and we simply have the best ones in town, equally entertaining, funny
        and informative.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant='h6' component='h6' paragraph>
        Our guide walks the group around the Old Town , and stop en-route to
        comment some of the monuments and hidden corners, as well as some
        gastro-bars to taste traditional tapas alongside with drinks.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant='h6' component='h6' paragraph>
        On the gastronomic front, the tour typically includes 2 or 3 stops for
        tapas in different parts of town, and it takes around 3.5 hours to
        complete.
