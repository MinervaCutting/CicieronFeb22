          Their specialty is anything fish-related. A typical meal at Mana 75
          starts with some pica-pica (tomato spread bread, squid rings, razor
          clams, ....), followed by a seafood paella, or some seabass, and
          ending with a delicious dessert. The restaurant serves top quality
          food with amazing and fast service.
