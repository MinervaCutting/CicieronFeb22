    . When we say, by the beach, we mean - almost at the
    <strong>sand</strong> - El Arenal meaning the
    <strong>sandy area</strong> in English.`,

    ` The restaurant can lay a couple of tables of 8, for a group of 16 in
    the terrace, al fresco, overlooking the Mediterranean, and dining in
    the sand.`,

    `Their food is varied, but this would be the perfect spot to enjoy a
    Paella by the beach. Their cuisine is strong in rices and paellas,
    fish and seafood dishes.`,

    ` The terrace can fit up to 40pax , and the total capacity of the
    restaurant is 100pax including the inner dining room.`,
