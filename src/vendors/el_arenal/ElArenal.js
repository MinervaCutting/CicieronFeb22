          <strong>El Arenal</strong> is one of the few restaurants in{" "}
          <em>Barcelona</em> that are located just by the beach - near{" "}
          <strong>Port Ol√≠mpic</strong> in la <strong>Barceloneta Beach</strong>
          . When we say, by the beach, we mean - almost at the{" "}
          <strong>sand</strong> - El Arenal meaning the{" "}
          <strong>sandy area</strong> in English.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='h6' component='h6' paragraph>
          The restaurant can lay a couple of tables of 8, for a group of 16 in
          the terrace, al fresco, overlooking the Mediterranean, and dining in
          the sand.

          Their food is varied, but this would be the perfect spot to enjoy a
          Paella by the beach. Their cuisine is strong in rices and paellas,
          fish and seafood dishes.

        <Typography variant='h6' component='h6' paragraph>
          The terrace can fit up to 40pax , and the total capacity of the
